# myFlix 

Creating the client side of the myFlix project.

## Technologies

This project is built on the MERN stack.  
Of course this means React is used for the frontend, with Redux to help maintain state.  
Redux wasn't actually necessary for a project of this scale, but we implemented just to learn.
Express and Node are utilized for the backend.  
Hosted on Netlify.
